Game Logic
----------
1. Save lives by dodging invaders.

2. Different invaders move at different speeds and in different formations based upon the player ship location, when invaders spawn:
	* Pink Invaders --- Very slow speed and travel distant to the player ship.
	* Blue Invaders --- Slow speed and travel near the player ship.
	* Green Invaders --- Moderate speed and target the player ship.
	* Yellow Invaders --- Fast speed and target the player ship.

3. Earn points by destroying invaders with missiles.

4. Earn an extra life (up to five lives at once) every 100 points.

5. The player ship can only fire one missile at a time. If a missile misses, the player ship must wait until the missile is out of sight to fire another missile. If a missile destroys an invader, the player ship can instantly fire another missile.
